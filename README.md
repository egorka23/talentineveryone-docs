CRITERION MET initially, but failed in Final Merits Determination:

"The record shows that the petitioner was the recipient of a 2024 Diploma of Laureate of the 1st Degree was given to the petitioner for his paper titled 'Modern approaches to planning and design of objects for detection and diagnostics of oncologic diseases' under the construction category.

Criterion not met.

But the evidence provides no information to establish the criteria used to grant the awards or prizes, the national or international significance of the awards, the number of awardees, and the limitations of the competitors.

Further, the 2024 Diploma of Laureate of the 1st Degree was given to the petitioner for his paper titled "Modern approaches to planning and design of objects for detection and diagnostics of oncologic diseases" which is not in the petitioner's field of business or architecture.

If the petitioner believes that the prizes or awards are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field, the petitioner may submit:
• The criteria used to give the prizes or awards.
• Information on the reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards.
• Documentary evidence demonstrating:
  • The significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition the prizes or awards share;
  • The reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards;
  • Who is considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope for which candidates may apply;
  • How many prizes or awards are awarded each year;
  • Previous winners who enjoy national or international acclaim; and,
• Documentary evidence establishing how the award(s) was/were given for excellence in the beneficiary's field.

This criterion has not been met as it has not been established that the primary purpose of the prizes or awards was to recognize excellence in the beneficiary's field. To demonstrate excellence in the field was the basis for the prizes or awards, the petitioner may submit:

```
// Officer: 0070
// Date: May-2025

This criterion has not been met.

First, while it also appeared that you received another award in 2023, this award material was in a foreign language and lacked a corresponding English translation and translator's certification. Since you did not submit properly certified translations of the documents, you have not demonstrated that the evidence supports your claims.

Second, while the record supported your receipt of awards from Alley of Stars Ukraine, Berlin Talente Europas, and New York Starlights, the record failed to suggest how these awards are for excellence in your field of endeavor. The record lacked any informational materials about these awards. And although the award certificates contained additional information, this information was illegible.

Third, it was also noted that the record failed to sufficiently support how any of your awards enjoy national or international recognition. The only informational materials found within the record were about the A'Design Award & Competition and the FIT Sport Design Awards; however, these materials originated from the awarding bodies themselves. USCIS does not consider informational materials from an awarding body about the national or international recognition of its own awards to be independent and objective evidence under this criterion.

Similarly, USCIS now doubts how the "Business Gravity Top 100" award is related to excellence in the field of business (rhythmic gymnastic attire). The informational materials for the award suggest the event recognizes "significant contributions to the transformation and modernization of Ukrainian business and volunteer movement."

Without additional information to support the national or international recognition enjoyed by any one of your awards, USCIS cannot conclude that this criterion has been met.

// Officer: 0070

This criterion has not been met.

First, USCIS acknowledges the record supports your receipt of the following awards:
• 2024 - TITAN Awards, Innovations in Services and Solutions - Sustainability & Environment Category, Silver Award
• 2024 - Worldwide Vets, Golden Star Award, Runner-Up

Second, while you have received awards for excellence in the field, the record fails to sufficiently support how either of your awards enjoys national or international recognition. All of the informational materials were either from the awarding bodies or from other award winners. USCIS does not consider informational materials from an awarding body about the national or international recognition of its own awards to be independent and objective evidence under this criterion.

Rather, national and international recognition results through the awareness of the accolade in the eyes of the field nationally or internationally. This recognition should be evident through specific means; for example, but not limited to, national or international-level media coverage. Without additional information, USCIS cannot conclude this criterion has been met.

If you believe that the prizes or awards are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field, then you may submit:
• The criteria used to give the prizes or awards
• Information on the reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards
• Documentary evidence demonstrating:
  • The significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition the prizes or awards share
  • The reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards
  • Who is considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope for which candidates may apply
  • How many prizes or awards are awarded each year

The evidence you submitted does not meet the "plain language" of this criterion.

USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 6, Part F, Chapter 2, B. Evidence of Extraordinary Ability, 1. Initial Evidence of Extraordinary Ability expresses in part:

First, USCIS determines if the person was the recipient of prizes or awards. The description of this type of evidence in the regulation indicates that the focus should be on the person's receipt of the awards or prizes, as opposed to the employer's receipt of the awards or prizes.

Second, USCIS determines whether the award is a lesser nationally or internationally recognized prize or award which the person received for excellence in the field of endeavor. As indicated by the plain language of the regulation, this criterion does not require an award or prize to have the same level of recognition and prestige as the Nobel Prize or Academy Award that would qualify as a one-time achievement.

You provided material related to your receipt of one (1) award in support of this criterion; however, the evidence does not meet the plain language of this criterion. First, USCIS acknowledges that the record supports your receipt of the following award:
• 2017 - Regional Ukrainian Association of Teachers and Psychologists, 17th Ukrainian National Competition - Title of the Best Psychologist of DNIPRO Region, Ukraine

Second, while you have received recognition in your field, the record fails to support how your award enjoys national or international recognition. The record contains no additional information about this award and how it enjoys national or international recognition. Additionally, the inclusion of the term "DNIPRO Region" leads USCIS to further doubt the national or international recognition of this award when it appears to only apply to a specific region of Ukraine. National and international recognition results through the awareness of the accolade in the eyes of the field nationally or internationally. This recognition should be evident through specific means; for example, but not limited to, national or international-level media coverage. Additionally, unsupported conclusory letters from those in your field are not sufficient evidence that a particular prize or award is nationally or internationally recognized. Therefore, the evidence does not establish that you have received a lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

If you believe that the prizes or awards are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field, then you may submit:
• The criteria used to give the prizes or awards.
• Information on the reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards.
• Documentary evidence demonstrating:
  o The significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition the prizes or awards share;
  o The reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards;
  o Who is considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope for which candidates may apply;
  o How many prizes or awards are awarded each year;
  o Previous winners who enjoy national or international acclaim; and
• Documentary evidence establishing how the awards were given for excellence in your field.

You may submit any other information about the prizes or awards that would help establish that the prizes or awards should be considered as nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

Note: For any prize or award submitted, also provide:
• A copy of each prize or award certificate; or
• A clear photograph of each prize or award; or
• Public announcement regarding the awarding of the prizes or awards issued by the granting organization.

As indicated by the plain language of the regulation, this criterion does not require an award or prize to have the same level of recognition and prestige associated with the Nobel Prize or another award that would qualify as a one-time achievement."

You provided awards materials and other informational materials in support of this criterion; however, the evidence does not meet the plain language of this criterion. First, the record supports your receipt of the following awards:
• 2024 - A'Design Award & Competition, Excellence in Design Certificate
• 2024 - fit Sport Design Awards, Sportswear Design category award winner
• 2024 - fit Sport Design Awards, Sport equipment design category award winner
• 2024 - Constellation World Talent Network Constellation World Starts, International Contest Fashion Design, 1st Place
• 2024 - Alley of Stars Ukraine, Grand Prix
• 2024 - Berlin Talente Europas, Grand Prix
• 2024 - New York Starlights, International Talent Content, Grand Prix
• 2023 - Business Gravity Top 100, Premier Sports Fashion and Accessories Designer of 2023

While it also appears that you received another award in 2023, this award material was in a foreign language and lacked a corresponding English translation and translator's certification. According to 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b)(3): "Any document containing foreign language submitted to [USCIS] shall be accompanied by a full English language translation which the translator has certified as complete and accurate, and by the translator's certification that he or she is competent to translate from the foreign language into English." Since you did not submit properly certified translations of the documents, you have not demonstrated that the evidence supports your claims. See Matter of Nevarez, 15 I&N Dec. 550 (BIA 1976). As such, the un-translated foreign language material was given no probative value under this criterion.

Second, while the record supports your receipt of awards from Alley of Stars Ukraine, Berlin Talente Europas, and New York Starlights, the record fails to suggest how these awards are for excellence in your field of endeavor. The record lacks any informational materials about these awards. And although the award certificates contain additional information, this information was illegible. According to Title 8 C.F.R § 204.5(g)(1): "In general, ordinary legible photocopies of [supporting] documents ... will be acceptable for initial filing and approval." As such, USCIS can glean nothing from illegible materials. Without additional informational regarding these awards and their relation to your field of endeavor, USCIS must give the materials little relevant value under this criterion.

Third, it must also be noted that the record fails to sufficiently support how any of your awards enjoy national or international recognition. The only informational materials found within the record were informational materials about the A'Design Award and Competition as well as the fit Sport Design Awards; however, these materials originated from the awarding bodies themselves. USCIS does not consider informational materials from an awarding body about the national or international recognition of its own awards to be independent and objective evidence under this criterion. Rather, national and international recognition results through the awareness of the accolade in the eyes of the field nationally or internationally. This recognition should be evident through specific means; for example, but not limited to, national or international-level media coverage. Additionally, unsupported conclusory letters from those in your field are not sufficient evidence that a particular prize or award is nationally or internationally recognized.

Further, USCIS acknowledges that you provided various web links in your cover letter for each of these awards, but, USCIS does not consider the submission of web links to be primary evidence under this criterion. You are required to provide actual copies of the evidence you are referencing in these web links. Simply going on record without substantive evidence to support assertions, is not sufficient in these proceedings. See Matter of Treasure Craft of California, 14 I&N Dec. 190 (BIA 1972). Without additional information to support the national or international recognition enjoyed by any one of your awards, USCIS cannot conclude that this criterion has been met. Therefore, the evidence does not establish that you have received a lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

If you believe that the prizes or awards are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field, then you may submit:
• The criteria used to give the prizes or awards.
• Information on the reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards.
• Documentary evidence demonstrating:
  o The significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition the prizes or awards share;
  o The reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards;

You may submit any other information about the prizes or awards that would help establish that the prizes or awards should be considered as nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

The plain language of this criterion requires evidence (1) of the beneficiary's receipt of a prize or award, (2) that the prize or award is in beneficiary's field, (3) that the prize or award is recognized nationally or internationally, and (4) that the award or prize is for excellence in the field of endeavor. The petitioner must satisfy all of these elements to meet the plain language requirements of this criterion.

Here, you submitted evidence stating in part, "The main goal of the competition is to stimulate the creation of interesting and useful Georgian websites, online stores, blogs, social networks, children's and educations internet resources. This year's competition marathon started on June 26 and will end on September 26. Applications close on September 19th. Every person or group who has decided to create a site with a unfinished internet project or even at the idea level is given the opportunity to refine their own site and participate in the competition. Only Georgian sites created in 2005-2007 will be able to participate in the competition. "Pirate" sites with illegal content will not be allowed to participate in the contest. The competition is held in 8 categories, with solid cash prizes. In addition, in a separate nomination the general sponsor of the competition, Magti, a cellular communication company, awards a prize for creating a Bali student website and image site in Bali."

The plain language of this criterion specifically requires that the petitioner's awards be nationally or internationally recognized in the field of endeavor. While a competition, conference, annual meeting, etc may open to national participants, that alone does not demonstrate that an award in such an event is a nationally or internationally recognized prize or award for excellence in the field. Of relevant consideration is the national or international significance of the award which has not been demonstrated. The petitioner has not submitted documentary evidence to demonstrate that these "National Internet Contests" were recognized beyond the context of the the specific competitions. Based on the criteria provided by the petitioner, these contest were opened to anyone wishing to compete. Therefore, these prizes do not meet the plain language of the regulation.

As such, the submitted evidence does not meet this criterion.

Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor;

Initially, you submitted evidence that you were the recipient of student recognitions/scholarships and that you have also been recognized by former employers. However, the RFE noted:

The record shows that you were the recipient of student recognitions/scholarships, but we do not consider such an honor to be a nationally or internationally recognized prize or award for excellence in the field of endeavor, because it is given only to students or early career professionals in the field, inherently excluding established professionals who have already achieved excellence.

The evidence shows that you were recognized by your employer, but we view work-related awards as local honors rather than nationally or internationally recognized awards since they are limited to employees who work for the corporations presenting the awards, inherently excluding the entire field. And therefore, such honors do not measure your standing or selection from among the entire field or show your extraordinary ability under this criterion.

To establish that prizes or awards are nationally or internationally recognized for excellence in your field of endeavor, you may submit documentary evidence demonstrating:
• the criteria used to give the prizes or awards
• national or international media coverage of prizes or awards
• the reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards
• who are considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope from which candidates are considered
• how many prizes or awards are awarded each year
• previous winners who enjoy national or international acclaim
• how prizes or awards are given for excellence in the beneficiary's field

You may submit any other information about the prizes or awards that would help establish that the prizes or awards should be considered as nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

Note: For each prize or award please also submit any of the following:
• a copy of each prize or award certificate
• a clear photograph of each prize or award
• a public announcement regarding the awarding of the prizes or awards issued by the granting organization

In response to the RFE, you maintain that receiving the Balashak Scholarship, being recognized as a High Performance Specialist as a contract worker for EXPO-2017, and receiving a recognition at a student scientific conference should qualify you under this criterion. However, scholarships are given only to students or early career professionals in the field, inherently excluding established professionals who have already achieved excellence. Likewise, the student conference was also limited to students who chose to attend that specific conference. Finally, we view work-related awards as local honors rather than nationally or internationally recognized awards since they are limited to employees who work for the corporations/events presenting the awards, inherently excluding the entire field. And therefore, such honors do not measure your standing or selection from among the scientists in the entire field or show your extraordinary ability under this criterion. Therefore, you have not presented evidence that you meet this regulatory criterion. This criterion remains unsatisfied.

Criterion Met.

Evidence of the beneficiary's awards, granted in 2022 and 2023, was submitted. The awards meets the requisite standard of national or international recognition for excellence and the regulatory criteria in part one is satisfied. However, for the analysis in part two, the beneficiary's record is evaluated to determine whether it was indicative of him being one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor and enjoying sustained national or international acclaim. As the awards were granted in 2022 and 2023, the record does not demonstrate that the beneficiary has sustained national or international acclaim. The beneficiary's record is not consistent with the regulatory definition of "extraordinary ability" as "a level of expertise indicating that the individual is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of Software Engineers.

This criterion has not been met as it has not been established that the prizes or awards were given for excellence in the beneficiary's field of endeavor, or that the primary purpose of the prizes or awards was to recognize excellence in the beneficiary's field. There is no evidence in the record indicating the petitioner wad granted these awards for excellence in the field as a software engineer.

To demonstrate excellence in the field was the basis for the prizes or awards, the petitioner may submit:
• Documentary evidence describing how the prizes or awards relate to excellence in the beneficiary's field.
• Documentary evidence of the criteria used to grant the prizes or awards, including evidence that a criterion for winning the prizes or awards was excellence in the field.

Additionally, this criterion has not been met because the beneficiary's prizes or awards do not appear to be nationally or internationally recognized. To show that they are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field, the petitioner may submit:
Documentary evidence demonstrating the following:
• The criteria used to grant the prizes or awards;
• The significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition that the prizes or awards share;
• The reputation of the organization or panel granting the prizes or awards;
• Who is considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope for which candidates may apply;
• How many prizes or awards are awarded each year; and,
• Previous winners of the award.

Finally, this criterion has not been met because the prizes or awards do not appear to relate to the beneficiary's field. The regulations regarding this preference classification are extremely restrictive, and not expanding "area" to include everything within a particular field cannot be considered unreasonable. INA 203(b)(1)(A)(ii) provides that you seek "to enter the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability," not areas of extraordinary ability. Thus, you may claim only one area (i.e., occupation and field) for each I-140 filing. See Lee v. Ziglar, 237 F. Supp. 2d 914, 918 (N.D. Ill. 2002) (illustrating that USCIS may reasonably interpret that continuing to work in one's "area of extraordinary ability" as working in the same profession in which one has extraordinary ability, not necessarily in any profession in that field). As such, awards won by the petitioner as an attorney or working as an investigator are not related to his claimed occupation of senior software engineer.

To assist in determining that the prizes or awards satisfy this criterion, the petitioner may submit:
• Documentary evidence of national or international prizes or awards received that were granted for excellence in the beneficiary's field.
• Documentary evidence establishing what the criterion was for winning the prizes or awards.
• Documentary evidence describing how the prizes or awards relate to the beneficiary's field.
• Documentary evidence of the following:
  - The significance of the prizes or awards;
  - Who is considered for the prizes or awards;
  - How many prizes or awards are given each year; and

The petitioner must satisfy all of these elements to meet the plain language requirements of this criterion.

The Data Teams Awards cannot be considered for this criterion because, while it lists the petitioner as a team member, it was awarded to his employer. The petitioner submitted letters attesting to the criteria used to grant the awards, but the actual material from the awarding organizations do not support the letters. The petitioner submitted media articles about the awarding organizations, but they appear to be promotional articles. The actual purpose of these awards appears to be for self-promotional purposes rather than to honor excellence in the field as the evidence indicates that winners must pay to receive trophies or additional certificates. The evidence fails to demonstrate that the awards were granted for excellence in the field, and that they are nationally or internationally recognized in the field.

The record must contain sufficient evidence to satisfy each of the plain language elements of this criterion. Therefore, please submit evidence:

To show the beneficiary's receipt of an award, for any prize or award submitted, please provide:

Evidence of the beneficiary's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor

USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 6, part F, chapter 2, Guidance expresses in part: "First, USCIS determines if the person was the recipient of prizes or awards. The description of this type of evidence in the regulation indicates that the focus should be on the person's receipt of the awards or prizes, as opposed to his or her employer's receipt of the awards or prizes. Relevant considerations regarding whether the basis for granting the prizes or awards was excellence in the field include, but are not limited to: The criteria used to grant the awards or prizes; The national or international significance of the awards or prizes in the field; The number of awardees or prize recipients; and Limitations on competitors."

We note your supposed awards (All Russian Business Rating, Innovations Time Award), however, the credibility of your documentation is compromised because the underlying employment (Gazprombank, Eurostek) appears to have been misrepresented.

Furthermore, you have only submitted self-made documentation lacking probative value.

As such, the submitted evidence does not meet the plain language for this criterion.

(i) Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor;

The petitioner submitted the following evidence:

a. Evidence of "Cases & Faces" award, 2024 International Business Awards;
b. Information about award;
c. Support articles; and,
d. Support letters.

The plain language of this criterion requires evidence (1) of the beneficiary's receipt of a prize or award, (2) that the prize or award is in beneficiary's field, (3) that the prize or award is recognized nationally or internationally, and (4) that the award or prize is for excellence in the field of endeavor. The petitioner must satisfy all of these elements to meet the plain language requirements of this criterion.

The evidence submitted does not meet the plain language of this criterion because sufficient evidence was not submitted to substantiate that the prize or award that the beneficiary received is recognized nationally or internationally. Sufficient evidence was not submitted to show the significance of the prize or award, who is considered for the prizes or awards, how many prizes or awards are given each year, or any previous winners who are related to the petitioner's field. In addition, objective, documentary evidence was not submitted describing how the prizes or awards are related to excellence in the beneficiary's field.

A prize or an award does not garner national or international recognition from the competition in which it is awarded, nor is it derived from the individual or group that issued the award. Rather, national and international recognition results through the awareness of the accolade in the eyes of the field nationally or internationally. This recognition should be evident through specific means: for example but not limited to, national or international-level media coverage. Additionally, unsupported conclusory letters from those in the beneficiary's field are not sufficient evidence that a particular prize or award is nationally or internationally recognized.

As such, the submitted evidence does not meet this criterion.

The petitioner submitted no evidence that the recipient of the above awards receives any sort of national or international recognition. It is incumbent upon the petitioner to submit such documentary evidence regarding significance of these awards, the record does not clearly establish that the petitioner's awards meet this criterion.

This material is not reliable documentation, nor does it comply with the regulatory requirements at 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b)(3).

You also provided copies of ranking sheets from 2018 (which were in some places illegible) and other vague material some of which appeared unsourced.

You have also submitted a letter that indicates a payment given to you from a Russian bank that is described as a grant award.

Recognition or list rankings are not evidence of actual awards, rather are acknowledgment of involvement and placement in events.

With regards to grants, while these are commendable, they are not receipt of an actual award but rather a type of funding for the potential of proposed future work. Thus, such documentation has no probative value for meeting this criterion. The type of funding that you receive for proposed endeavors is not evidence of the actual contributions to the claimed field of expertise.

With the above characteristics noted, some diplomas did not indicate the type of competition, therefore, it could not be ascertained if the evidence presented related to your field of endeavor.

In addition, diplomas appear to have been given from several regional competitions.

We do not consider such honors to be nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor, because they are regional annual competitions limited to the participants of the regions where those competitions were held. In addition, it is noted, that some of the competitions appear to be for students, youth or early career professionals in the field, inherently excluding established professionals who have already achieved excellence in the field of endeavor. Moreover then, these honors would not measure your standing or selection from the entire field of endeavor.

Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor. Title 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i).

The NOID requested the petitioner submit additional evidence regarding the petitioner's claim to documentation of the non-citizen's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor. Title 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i). In response to the NOID the petitioner did not provide any additional evidence in support of the claimed criterion. Without additional evidence, the petitioner by a preponderance has not met the plain language of the criterion.

Accordingly, based on the relevant documents in the record, the petitioner has not demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, the claimed awards demonstrate receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

The criterion is not met. The petitioner submitted evidence of receipt of prizes and awards, including:
A National Award for Excellence in Appraisal, 10th Anniversary Congress of the Russian Federation Valuation Industry, 2023.
Honorary Gratitude for Great Personal Contribution to Evaluation Activities in Russia, 2008-2009, National Council for Evaluation Activities.
Kudryavtsev Badge of Honor, 2008, National Recognition for Outstanding Contributions to Appraisal and Valuation in Russia's Real Estate Sector.
Medal of Honor (II Degree) 2010, National Recognition for Distinguished Contributions to the Development of the Appraisal Industry in Russia.
European-Singapore Economic Valuation Research Grant 2022, International Recognition for Advanced Studies in Auditing and Appraisal Methodologies.
However, the petitioner submitted no evidence that such awards or prizes are prestigious and coveted by distinguished Business Appraisers, evincing that they are recognized nationally or internationally beyond the awarding entities.
Furthermore, the petitioner has not submitted all required elements for each award, please see below.
To assist in determining that awards satisfy this criterion, the petitioner may submit:
The criteria used to grant the awards or prizes;
The national or international significance of the awards or prizes in the field;
The number of awardees or prize recipients; and
Limitations on competitors.
Thus, for each prize or award submit any of the following:
a copy of each prize or award certificate;
a clear photograph of each prize or award;
a public announcement regarding the awarding of the prize or award to you issued by the granting organization.
Also, the submission of national or international media would be helpful in determining if such a prize or award is nationally or internationally recognized for excellence. Note that media coverage by newspapers specific to one location or region is insufficient to prove that a prize or award is nationally or internationally recognized.

Documentation of the beneficiary's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

As indicated in the RFE, the petitioner has not shown that he is the recipient of a nationally or internationally recognized award for excellence.

The petitioner's response did not provide evidence of the petitioner's receipt of a nationally or internationally recognized award for excellence. Rather, counsel reiterated the claim from the initial submission, that the petitioner should be considered as the recipient of awards bestowed upon his company, claiming that his "role as a co-founder and key player in the team directly supports his qualification under this criterion". As stated in the RFE, the petitioner has not demonstrated that he is the recipient of an award, or that an award given to a company constitutes a team award.

The USCIS Policy Manual's guidance stipulates that:

First, USCIS determines if the person was the recipient of prizes or awards. Nothing precludes the person from relying on a team award, provided the person is one of the recipients of the award. The description of this type of evidence in the regulation indicates that the focus should be on the person's receipt of the awards or prizes, as opposed to the employer's receipt of the awards or prizes. [emphasis added]

In general, qualifying awards include team awards where each member receives a trophy, certification, or medal; appears on the podium or stage; or is specifically named in the awarding organization's announcement of the award selection. Examples include members of a musical group who receive an award and relay team members who appear together on the medal podium. Mere acknowledgment from the award recipient does not constitute receiving the award from the awarding authority.

The petitioner provided photos with no indication of what the award is and who is the recipient of the award. Of note, there is a photo of an award in a language other than English with no certified translation provided. Therefore, this evidence does not demonstrate that the petitioner is the recipient of the award.

Although counsel asserts that this is a team award, the assertions of counsel do not constitute evidence. Furthermore, although Counsel refers to the Policy Manual's guidance that "nothing precludes the person from relying on a team award, provided the person is one of the recipients of the award", the record does not demonstrate that the petitioner is "one of the recipients of the award."

USCIS notes that counsel's brief acknowledges that the employer is the recipient of the award. The Policy Manual clearly states that "the focus should be on the person's receipt of the awards or prizes, as opposed to the employer's receipt of the awards or prizes." As the focus is on the employer, not the petitioner, his role as co-founder and co-owner is not material to the issue.

The evidence does not demonstrate that this meets the additional guidance indicating that this is a team award in the context of the Policy Manual's examples of a team award which include "team awards where each member receives a trophy, certification, or medal; appears on the podium or stage" or "is specifically named in the awarding organization's announcement of the award selection." There is no indication that each "team member" received a trophy, certification, or medal or that each are specifically named in the announcement of the award.

While the petitioner provided photos that counsel states are of the petitioner appearing "on the podium or stage, holding the award", as there is no indication that the petitioner was on stage when the award was granted or that all members of "the team" were on stage with him to receive the award. Therefore, a photo of the petitioner on a stage with an award is not sufficient to demonstrate that this is a team award. As the record shows, and counsel acknowledges, that the employer is the recipient of the award, the plain language of the criterion has not been met.

The record does not establish that the petitioner is the recipient of a lesser nationally or internationally recognized award. Therefore, it is not necessary to discuss whether the awards are nationally or internationally recognized prizes for excellence.

As such, the plain language of the criterion has not been met.

Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

The petitioner provided evidence of being recognized as the Best Teacher Artist of the Year for 2022, 2023, 2024.

The petitioner provided information about the award that comes directly from the awarding entity. The evidence does not establish the significance and magnitude of the award and the extent to which the winners are recognized beyond the issuing body. The record does not contain any other evidence related to the award, such as the eligibility criteria, the number of entrants, or evidence showing that the recipients of the award were announced in major media or in some other manner consistent with a nationally or internationally recognized award.

The evidence does not indicate that the awards garnered national or international-level media coverage to demonstrate that the prizes or awards satisfy the plain language requirements of this criterion. The letter of support contends that the contests are prestigious awards, however, this is not supported in the record. Media coverage by newspapers specific to one location or region is insufficient to reflect the award is nationally or internationally recognized. It is the recognition that the award receives in the field on a broader level, beyond the issuing organization or event, that determines whether it satisfies that element of this criterion.

As such, the plain language of the criterion has not been met.

This criterion has not been met because the record does not show that they are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field. If the petitioner believes that the prizes or awards are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field, the petitioner may submit:
• The criteria used to give the prizes or awards.
• Information on the reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards.
• Documentary evidence demonstrating: o The significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition the prizes or awards share; o The reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards; o Who is considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope for which candidates may apply; o How many prizes or awards are awarded each year; o Previous winners who enjoy national or international acclaim; and,
• Documentary evidence establishing how the award(s) was/were given for excellence in the beneficiary's field.
• Documentary evidence describing how the prizes or awards relate to excellence in the beneficiary's field.
• Documentary evidence of the criteria used to grant the prizes or awards, including evidence that a criterion for winning the prizes or awards was excellence in the field.

The petitioner may submit any other information about the prizes or awards that would help establish that the prizes or awards should be considered as nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

The petitioner submitted the following in support of this criterion:
• Won a tender for the general contractor for the construction of a new office building
• Best Work Place Project (Federal Arendator Awards 2021)

The evidence indicates that the prize was awarded to the employer, not the petitioner. The USCIS Policy Manual specifies that first prong of meeting the criterion is to determine "if the person was the recipient of prizes or awards. The description of this type of evidence in the regulation indicates that the focus should be on the person's receipt of the awards or prizes, as opposed to the employer's receipt of the awards or prizes".

Additionally, evidence that the petitioner's company was selected as the contractors for a project, i.e. "won a tender", is not an example of winning a prize or award in the context of this criterion. The record includes numerous examples of projects awarded to the petitioner's company. This is evidence that the company is conducting business, rather than their receipt of nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence. The petitioner has not established that winning a bid for a contract is commensurate with a nationally or internationally recognized award or prize for excellence.

USCIS notes that the petitioner is also claiming the Best "Fit-out project" award. This prize appears to have been awarded to Inventive Retail Group with recognition made to GPGroup as the company who was responsible for the construction of the building. As stated above, in order to meet the criterion requirements, the focus should be on the individual, not their company or client. Likewise, the company's receipt of Best Work Place Project does not meet the criterion requirements. Furthermore, the petitioner must also show that the Arendator Awards are nationally or internationally recognized awards for excellence in the field.

The record does not show that this requirement has been met.

If the petitioner believes that the prizes or awards are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field, the petitioner may submit:
• The criteria used to give the prizes or awards.
• Information on the reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards.
• Documentary evidence demonstrating: o The significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition the prizes or awards share; o The reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards; o Who is considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope for which candidates may apply; o How many prizes or awards are awarded each year; o Previous winners who enjoy national or international acclaim; and,
• Documentary evidence establishing how the award(s) was/were given for excellence in the beneficiary's field.

The petitioner may submit any other information about the prizes or awards that would help establish that the prizes or awards should be considered as nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor. Additionally, the petitioner must submit evidence that he is the recipient of the award rather than his company or client.

The petitioner provided the following as evidence of having met this criterion:
• Awards for films: • Hooked - NA IGRE • Kilometer Zero • The Last Weekend • Total Transformation - Polnoe Prevrashenie
• Awards for novels: • "Bury me behind the baseboard" • "Chronicles of a slacker"

The evidence does not demonstrate that the prizes awarded to the various works of the petitioner are nationally or internationally recognized prizes. Furthermore, in order for USCIS to determine if the petitioner has met the plain language of this criterion, the petitioner must indicate the field of endeavor and show that the awards are for excellence in the field.

This criterion has not been met as it has not been established that the prizes or awards were given for excellence in the beneficiary's field of endeavor, or that the primary purpose of the prizes or awards was to recognize excellence in the beneficiary's field. To demonstrate excellence in the field was the basis for the prizes or awards, the petitioner may submit:
• Documentary evidence describing how the prizes or awards relate to excellence in the beneficiary's field.
• Documentary evidence of the criteria used to grant the prizes or awards, including evidence that a criterion for winning the prizes or awards was excellence in the field.

This criterion has not been met because the beneficiary's prizes or awards appear to be local or regional in nature. To show that they are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field, the petitioner may submit:
• Documentary evidence demonstrating the following: • The criteria used to grant the prizes or awards; • The significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition that the prizes or awards share; • The reputation of the organization or panel granting the prizes or awards; • Who is considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope for which candidates may apply; • How many prizes or awards are awarded each year; and, • Previous winners of the award.

The petitioner has submitted prizes or awards received by the petitioner that appear to have been received while pursuing an education. Generally, such honors are not considered to be nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor, because they are generally given to students or early career professionals in the field and inherently exclude established professionals who have already achieved excellence in the field of endeavor. If the petitioner believes that the prizes or awards are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field, the petitioner may submit:
• The criteria used to give the prizes or awards.
• Information on the reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards.
• Documentary evidence demonstrating: • The significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition the prizes or awards share; • The reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards; • Who is considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope for which candidates may apply; • How many prizes or awards are awarded each year; • Previous winners who enjoy national or international acclaim; and, • Documentary evidence establishing how the award(s) was/were given for excellence in the beneficiary's field.

The petitioner may submit any other information about the prizes or awards that would help establish that the prizes or awards should be considered as nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

This criterion has not been met because the prizes or awards do not appear to relate to the petitioner's field. To assist in determining that the prizes or awards satisfy this criterion, the petitioner may submit:
• Documentary evidence of national or international prizes or awards received that were granted for excellence in the beneficiary's field.
• Documentary evidence establishing what the criterion was for winning the prizes or awards.
• Documentary evidence describing how the prizes or awards relate to the beneficiary's field.
• Documentary evidence of the following: • The significance of the prizes or awards; • Who is considered for the prizes or awards; • How many prizes or awards are given each year; and • Previous winners who are related to the beneficiary's field.

Finally, you submitted a letter from Sofia Fomicheva, Editor in Chief of MUACLUB. However, the letter is not probative because it does not include the author's contact information and therefore does not meet the initial evidence requirements at Title 8 CFR 204.5(g)(1).

Criterion not met

USCIS Policy Manual Chapter 6, part F, chapter 2 expresses that, when determining the national or international recognition of prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor, we should consider any "limitations on competitors."

A prize or an award does not garner national or international recognition from the competition in which it is awarded, nor is it derived from the individual or group that issued the award. Rather, national and international recognition results through the awareness of the accolade in the eyes of the field nationally or internationally. This recognition should be evident through specific means; for example, through media coverage. Additionally, unsupported conclusory letters from those in your field are not sufficient evidence that a particular prize or award is nationally or internationally recognized. See 1756, Inc. v. The Attorney General of the United States, 745 F. Supp. 9, 15 (D.C. Dist 1990).

Evidence submitted in support of this criterion includes:

The submission of a single translation certification that does not specifically identify the document or documents it purportedly accompanies does not meet the requirements of the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b)(3). Because you did not submit properly certified translations of the documents, you have not demonstrated that the evidence supports your claims. Please resubmit your foreign language document accompanied by an English translation properly certified in accordance with 8 C.F.R. §103.2(b)(3).

The record showed that you were the recipient of the awards listed above. You also provided your own explanation and narrative about the awards, awarding events, or organizations with screenshots of the information from their websites, but without objectivity, these explanations have little evidentiary weight.

Additionally, the supporting evidence is insufficient to establish that these awards are a lesser nationally or internationally recognized prize or award which the person received for excellence in the field of endeavor. The evidence did not clearly demonstrate that your awards are prestigious, were given by prestigious events or organizations, or is coveted by all distinguished photographers, evincing your national or international recognition in the field.

It must be noted that you submitted online news media reports, but there is no probative evidence to establish the articles are considered major media, nor was there discussion on whether this award is considered prestigious by the field.

If you believe that the prizes or awards are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field, you may submit:

The criteria used to give the prizes or awards.
Information on the reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards.
Documentary evidence demonstrating:

Please highlight any part of the documentation which relates to the criteria of excellence, the award's significance in your field, application process, number of prizes granted and how often, and national recognition of the award itself.

Note: For any prize or award submitted, please also provide:

The criterion is not met.

The RFE stated:

The record shows that the beneficiary was the recipient of the Gold Medal from New York Realism, along with several certificates of achievement, and a diploma from the Kyiv city state administration General Directorate for Internal Affairs, but the evidence does not establish that these prizes or awards are nationally or internationally recognized for excellence in the field of endeavor.

To establish that these prizes or awards are nationally or internationally recognized for excellence in the beneficiary's field of endeavor, you may submit documentary evidence demonstrating:

• the criteria used to give the prizes or awards
• national or international media coverage of prizes or awards
• the reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards
• who are considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope from which candidates may apply
• how many prizes or awards are awarded each year
• previous winners who enjoy national or international acclaim
• how prizes or awards are given for excellence in the beneficiary's field

In response to the RFE you provided:

• Diploma for winning the exhibition of "My America" dated July 4 - August 4, 2020
• An introductory biography of you in the International Salon of Contemporary Art, dated July 4 - August 4, as an exhibiting artist
• Runner up Certificate presented by the 40TH Artavita Online Art Contest, with an issue date of September 2020
• Winner Certificate presented by the 41ST ARTAVITA Online Art Contest, with an issue date of September 2020
• Certificate of Recognition presented by Artios Gallery, dated October 1 - November 1, 2020
• An email stating that your artwork has been accepted for the Artexpo, New York 2021, that appears to be dated August 19, 2020
• A letter from Berik Kulmamirov, Fine Arts Chair at the Fine Art Studio New York, that states you won a gold medal at the International Fine Art exhibition contest.

The letter from Berik Kulmamirov, simply states that you won a gold medal, however, does not provide any of the evidence requested from the RFE. Simply providing statements for receipt of any award, without corroborating evidence, does not satisfy the elements of this criterion.

It is noted that the filing date of your Form I-140 is February 21, 2020. The above-mentioned evidence regarding receipt of awards and certificates are all dated after your filing date. Yet according to the matter of Matter of Katigbak, a petitioner cannot establish eligibility under this criterion based on the expectation of future significance. Eligibility must be demonstrated at the time of filing. See 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b)(1), (12); Matter of Katigbak, 14 I&N Dec. 45, 49 (Comm. 1971). Therefore, prizes or awards dated after the filing date, are not probative.

As such, you did not provide sufficient evidence to meet the plain language of the criterion.

Documentation of the beneficiary's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

The petitioner indicates she has received the following awards:

• 3 International Architecture & Design Awards (IADA);
• 1st place ARTDOM Talents 2025; and
• Conference participation.

The plain language of this criterion requires evidence (1) of the beneficiary's receipt of a prize or award, (2) that the prize or award is in beneficiary's field, (3) that the prize or award is recognized nationally or internationally, and (4) that the award or prize is for excellence in the field of endeavor. The petitioner must satisfy all of these elements to meet the plain language requirements of this criterion.

In support of this requirement the petitioner provided a copy of the award certificate, letters of support, as well as media reports, and information regarding the issuing organization.

Although the petitioner demonstrated that she received the above-referenced awards, she did not submit sufficient documentary evidence that the awards garnered national or international-level media coverage to demonstrate that his prizes or awards satisfy the plain language requirements of this criterion. The petitioner's assertions regarding the prestigious reputation of the contests are not supported in the record. It is the recognition that the award receives in the field on a broader level, beyond the issuing organization or event, that determines whether it satisfies that element of this criterion.

The petitioner submitted copies of the her 2025 IADA certificates, information about the awards, the judges and past winners. However, the petitioner did not submit objective, documentary evidence of the criteria used to grant the awards, and the evidence fails to demonstrate that the awards are recognized nationally or internationally but rather only by its respective awarding association. The actual purpose of these awards, appears to be entirely for self-promotional purposes. The evidence appears to be an attempt by the petitioner to elevate her claim by trying to meet this criterion.

The petitioner submitted a copy of her 1st place Artdom Talents certificate, information about the award, the judges and past winners. The petitioner submitted material about the organization from its own website, but the petitioner did not submit any objective, documentary evidence which demonstrates that the award receives in the field on a broader level, beyond the issuing organization or event. USCIS attempted to access the website from the link in the submitted evidence, but it is no longer available. This appears to further demonstrate that this is a promotional awarded, and it raises doubts about whether the awards are promotional in nature.

The petitioner submitted evidence of her participation in conferences. Participation in scientific conferences and symposia of the petitioner's kind is routine and expected. Many professional fields regularly hold conferences and symposiums to present new work, discuss new findings, and to network with other professionals. These conferences are promoted and sponsored by professional associations, businesses, educational institutions, and government agencies. Participation in such events, however, does not elevate the petitioner above almost all others in his field at the national or international level nor meet the plain language requirements of this criterion.

As such, the submitted evidence does not meet this criterion.

Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor

The petitioner indicates she has received the following awards:

• 3 International Architecture & Design Awards (IADA);
• 1st place ARTDOM Talents 2025; and
• Conference participation.

The plain language of this criterion requires evidence (1) of the beneficiary's receipt of a prize or award, (2) that the prize or award is in beneficiary's field, (3) that the prize or award is recognized nationally or internationally, and (4) that the award or prize is for excellence in the field of endeavor. The petitioner must satisfy all of these elements to meet the plain language requirements of this criterion.

In response to the RFE, the petitioner states,"The International Architecture & Design Awards (IADA 2025) event was covered by a number of international and industry media with substantial audiences and standing within the professional communities of architects, designersm and 3D visualizers:"

The petitioner points to SimilarWeb data showing the number of visits to the websites of the various publications, but raw numbers do not provide the comparison to other circulation figures required by the USCIS Policy Manual guidance. Similar Web data does provide comparative evidence in the form of rankings by country and category, as well as globally. A review of these rankings do not establish these publications as a major trade publication or other major media.

Although the record contains some information about the award issuing entities, it lacks sufficient evidence confirming the awards that the petitioner received enjoy national or international· recognition for excellence in the field of architecture and design. For example, she has not presented materials showing that publications or news outlets with a national or international audience reported on the awards or their recipients, or other documentation confirming that these honors are accepted in the field as national or international recognition for excellence. The actual purpose of these awards (IADA and ARTDOM) appears to be entirely for self-promotional purposes. The evidence appears to be an attempt by the petitioner to elevate her claim by trying to meet this criterion.

As such, the submitted evidence does not meet this criterion.

Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor

The petitioner submitted a list of "Winners in the 2025 Stevie Awards for Technology Excellence" showing the petitioner as a "Bronze Stevie Winner" for "Employee of the Year-Software" category and a "Bronze Stevie Winner" for "Employee of the Year" in the Transportation Technology category. In addition, the petitioner submitted an overview of the stevie awards from their website and articles about the recognition of the Stevie Awards. However, this criterion has not been met because the award does not appear to be a major, internationally recognized award.

The petitioner has not sufficiently explained how winning a Bronze Stevie for "Employee of the Year-Software" and "Employee of the Year" (Transportation Technology) establishes a one-time achievement, specifically a major, internationally recognized award. While the petitioner won bronze, she did not even win a silver or a gold. The petitioner in this case has not demonstrated how a bronze constitutes a one-time achievement, specifically a major, internationally recognized award when she did not win a silver or a gold. In addition, sixteen other individuals won the bronze also for "Employee of the Year-Software" and two other individuals won the bronze also for the "Employee of the Year" (Transportation Technology). While the petitioner submitted articles stating the Stevie Awards are the "Oscars of the business world," the petitioner did not provide evidence that her awards garnered international recognition, nor has she shown, for example, that her awards were accompanied by large cash prizes, prestige, or media attention about her. In addition, according to the Stevies-tech website "FAQ," "Silver and Bronze Award winners will receive a Silver or Bronze medal, and have the option to purchase their Silver or Bronze Stevie Award trophy in the Stevie Awards Store...Winners who attend the optional awards ceremony will receive all of their awards there...Winners who are unable to attend have the option to pay a shipping fee to receive their award(s) at their home or office." It is unclear why a one-time achievement that is a major, internationally-recognized award would require winners to pay for their own trophy; that "attending the ceremony is optional;" and that a bronze winner only receives a medal "depending on their score in final judging."

The regulation at 8 C.F.R. Section 204.5(h)(3) states that sustained national or international acclaim can be established through evidence of a one-time achievement, specifically a major, internationally recognized award. Given Congress' intent to restrict this category to "that small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of their field of endeavor," the regulation permitting eligibility based on a one-time achievement must be interpreted very narrowly, with only a small handful of awards qualifying as major, internationally recognized awards. See H.R. Rep. 101-723, 59 (Sept. 19, 1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6710, 1990 WL 200418 at *6739. The regulation is consistent with this legislative history, stating that a one-time achievement must be a major, internationally recognized award. 8 C.F.R. Section 204.5(h)(3). The selection of Nobel Laureates, the example provided by Congress, is reported in the top media internationally regardless of the nationality of the awardees, is a familiar name to the public at large, and includes a large cash prize. While an internationally recognized award could conceivably constitute a one-time achievement without meeting all of those elements, it is clear from the example provided by Congress that the award must be internationally recognized in the beneficiary's field as one of the top awards in that field.

To show that the award is a major, internationally recognized award, the petitioner may submit documentary evidence to show:

• The award is internationally recognized in the field as one of the top awards for the field;
• The criteria used to grant the award;
• The significance of the award in the field;
• The reputation of the organization or the panel granting the award;
• Previous winners of the award who enjoyed international acclaim at the time of receiving the award; and,
• The award attracts competition from internationally recognized individuals in the field.

The petitioner has not established that the beneficiary has received a one-time achievement that is a major, internationally recognized prize or award. As a result, the evidence must demonstrate that the beneficiary has fulfilled at least three of the ten criteria listed in the regulations.

USCIS has determined that the petitioner has provided sufficient documentation to establish the beneficiary has met the following regulatory criteria:

• Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor;
• Published material about the alien in professional or major trade publications or other major media, relating to the alien's work in the field for which classification is sought. Such evidence shall include the title, date, and author of the material, and any necessary translation;
• Evidence of the alien's participation, either individually or on a panel, as a judge of the work of others in the same or an allied field of specification for which classification is sought;
• Evidence of the alien's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional or major trade publications or other major media;
• Evidence that the alien has performed in a leading or critical role for organizations or establishments that have a distinguished reputation.

USCIS has determined that the petitioner provided documentation, but failed to establish eligibility for the following criteria:

Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

In the initial submission, the petitioner provided award materials and informational materials in support of this criterion; however, the evidence did not meet the plain language of this criterion. USCIS acknowledged the record supported the petitioner's receipt of the following awards:

• 2024 - TITAN Awards, Innovations in Services and Solutions - Sustainability & Environment Category, Silver Award

• 2024 - Worldwide Vets, Golden Star Award, Runner-Up

While the petitioner has received awards for excellence in the field, the record failed to sufficiently support how either of the awards enjoy national or international recognition. All of the informational materials were either from the awarding bodies or from other award winners. USCIS did not consider informational materials from an awarding body about the national or international recognition of its own awards to be independent and objective evidence under this criterion. Rather, national and international recognition results through the awareness of the accolade in the eyes of the field nationally or internationally. This recognition should be evident through specific means; for example, but not limited to, national or international-level media coverage. Without additional information, USCIS could not conclude this criterion had been met.

In the RFE response, the petitioner provided a cover letter, reference letters, published materials, and informational materials in support of this criterion. After reviewing the totality of the evidence, USCIS has determined the evidence does not meet the plain language of this criterion. The record still lacks sufficient evidence to support how either of the petitioner's awards enjoys national or international recognition. All of the informational materials continued to originate from the awarding bodies and USCIS need not accept self-serving assertions of an organization's own claimed status. See Braga v. Poulos, No. CV 06-5105 SJO (C.D. Cal. July 6, 2007), aff'd, 317 F. App'x 680 (9th Cir. 2009) (concluding that the AAO did not have to rely on self-serving assertions on the cover of a magazine as to the magazine's status as major media). Similarly, USCIS must focus on the award, not its issuer. Krasniqi v. Dibbins, 558 F. Supp. 3d 168, 182 (D.N.J. 2021) (quoting Visinscaia v. Beers, 4 F. Supp. 3d 126, 136 (D.D.C. 2013)) (requiring evidence showing "how a larger audience viewed [the] awards"). When considering recognition, we focus on "how a larger audience viewed [the] awards." Krasniqi v. Dibbins, 558 F. Supp. 3d 168, 182 (D.N.J. 2021) (quoting Visinscaia v. Beers, 4 F. Supp. 3d 126, 136 (D.D.C. 2013)).

The published materials were either paid press releases from the awarding body (e.g., marketwatch.com, PR Newswire, etc.) or were from publications of unknown national or international significance (e.g., VetNews, uktechnews.co.uk, tolfacharity.org, etc.). It is also worth noting that all of the published materials failed to recognize either of the petitioner's awards in their coverage. USCIS is not persuaded how paid media coverage or media coverage from unknown nationally or internationally significant publications which make no mention of the petitioner's awards sufficiently illustrate the national or international recognition enjoyed by either award. And while the record contains various reference letters discussing the significance of the petitioner's awards, the record still lacks corroborating evidence and USCIS need not accept primarily conclusory statements. See 1756, Inc. v. The U.S. Att'y Gen., 745 F. Supp. 9, 15 (D.C. Dist. 1990). Therefore, the evidence does not establish that you have received lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

As such, the submitted evidence does not meet this criterion.

The letters of gratitude highlight participation in helping with the organization and promotion of Digital Astana 2024 International Forum. However, the evidence submitted does not sufficiently demonstrate that the prize(s) or award(s) claimed under 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i) are nationally or internationally recognized. Pursuant to USCIS regulations, the petitioner must provide documentation showing that the award has a significant reputation beyond a local or regional scope and is acknowledged within the beneficiary's field on a national or international level.

Please submit additional evidence, such as:

• documentation detailing the award's selection criteria and its reputation in the field:
• evidence of the awarding organization's national or international standing;
• media articles or publications discussing the award's significance; or
• letters from experts in the field attesting to the award's prestige and recognition.

Moreover, the certificates provided were awarded based on completing training. The evidence provided does not adequately establish that the prize(s) or award(s) were granted for excellence in the beneficiary's field of endeavor, as required by 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i).

Documentation of the beneficiary's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

The plain language of this criterion requires evidence (1) of the beneficiary's receipt of a prize or award, (2) that the prize or award is in the beneficiary's field, (3) that the prize or award is recognized nationally or internationally, and (4) that the award or prize is for excellence in the field of endeavor. The petitioner must satisfy all of these elements to meet the plain language requirements of this criterion.

With the initial I-140 petition, the petitioner provided:
• Detailed Statement
• 2 Letters of Gratitude
• 3 Certificates

In response to the RFE the petitioner submitted:
• Petitioner's Statement
• Media coverage of Digital Almaty awards in international press
• Documentation from Digital Almaty organizers confirming the high level of the events and the beneficiary's role in it
• Documentation from MOST Business-Angel School confirming selective criteria and merit-based recognition
• Nomination letter from LLC Unified Service 301 for the 2025 Company of the Year award from the National Information and Analytical Center, and information about the award (brochure)
• Nomination letter for Aibo LLC
• Invitation to the 10th Anniversary of the Golden Medal Award Ceremony

However, the evidence you listed is insufficient because it fails to deliver concrete proof that the petitioner has personally received a nationally or internationally recognized award for individual excellence in their field. Specifically, media coverage of an event, such as the Digital Almaty awards, does not confirm the individual received a prize, and team-based awards are generally not considered. Furthermore, nomination letters, such as those for the 2025 Company of the Year award or from Aibo LLC, are not the same as winning the prize itself. Likewise, an invitation to an awards ceremony does not confirm that the recipient won an award. While documentation showing selective criteria for organizations like MOST Business-Angel School can be supportive, it is not sufficient on its own to meet the standard for receiving a prestigious award.

Finally, the evidence does not clearly and directly demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim for the individual's extraordinary ability in digital innovation, business leadership, or management.

Hence, the evidence provided does not adequately establish that the prize(s) or award(s) were granted for excellence in the petitioner's field of endeavor, as required by 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i).

Immigration law mandates that the award must reflect outstanding achievement directly related to the petitioner's area of expertise, and the petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating this nexus. The record does not clearly show how the award recognizes the petitioner's specific contributions or expertise in the field. Additionally, the documentation does not clarify whether the award was granted based on merit or other factors, such as participation or general contribution.

To assess whether the petitioner is eligible under this criterion, USCIS must first determine if the person was the recipient of prizes or awards. The description of this type of evidence in the regulation indicates that the focus should be on the person's receipt of the awards or prizes, as opposed to his employer's receipt of the awards or prizes. Second, USCIS determines whether the person has received less nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor. Relevant considerations regarding whether the basis for granting the prizes or awards was excellence in the field include, but are not limited to: the criteria used to grant the awards or prizes; the national or international significance of the awards or prizes in the field; and The number of awardees or prize recipients, as well as any limitations on competitors (an award limited to competitors from a single institution, for example, may have little national or international significance).See USCIS Policy Manual: Volume 6, Part F, Chapter 2, Appendices.

In support of your eligibility under this regulatory criterion, you provided evidence that the beneficiary received a "Dental Specialist of the Year 2022 Award" from her employer with additional information about the employer.

6 USCIS Policy Manual F.2 Appendix expresses that, when determining the national or international recognition of prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor, we should consider "any limitations on competitors." The evidence shows that your employer recognized your work, but we view work-related awards as local honors rather than nationally or internationally recognized awards since they are limited to employees who work for the organizations presenting the awards, inherently excluding the rest of field. And therefore, such honors do not measure your standing or selection from among dental researchers in the entire field or show your extraordinary ability under this criterion.

Considering these deficiencies, the petitioner was afforded an opportunity to submit additional documentation in support of this criterion. The petitioner's response included:
    A list of Demokrat dental offices;
    Information about Demokrat;
    Information about the Demokrat CEO;    
    Information about other award recipients;
    A letter of commendation;    
    Awards for academic excellence.

You have submitted evidence (letters of commendation) that it would like USCIS to consider as "comparable." The evidence submitted cannot be considered "comparable" as it has not been established that the regulatory criteria do not readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation. Simply submitted letters and claiming "comparable evidence" does not meet your burden of proof. The ten regulatory criteria are designed to cover different areas, and not every criterion will apply to every occupation. The regulatory language precludes consideration of comparable evidence in this case since there is no indication that eligibility for visa preference in your occupation cannot be established by the ten criteria specified by the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3). Where you are simply unable to meet three of these criteria, the plain language of the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(4) does not allow for the submission of comparable evidence.

You have submitted evidence of awards from your employer. However, as previously stated, 6 USCIS Policy Manual F.2 Appendix expresses that, when determining the national or international recognition of prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor, we should consider "any limitations on competitors." The evidence shows that your employer recognized your work, but we view work-related awards as local honors rather than nationally or internationally recognized awards since they are limited to employees who work for the organizations presenting the awards, inherently excluding the rest of field. And therefore, such honors do not measure your standing or selection from among dental researchers in the entire field or show your extraordinary ability under this criterion.

You submitted evidence that you have received academic awards. However, academic study is not a field of endeavor, but training for a future field of endeavor. As such, academic scholarships, student awards, and financial aid awards cannot be considered nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards in the field of endeavor. Therefore, the criterion remains unmet.

Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

The plain language of this criterion requires evidence (1) of the petitioner's receipt of a prize or award, (2) that the prize or award is in petitioner's field, (3) that the prize or award is recognized nationally or internationally, and (4) that the award or prize is for excellence in the field of endeavor. The petitioner must satisfy all of these elements to meet the plain language requirements of this criterion.

The evidence establishes the petitioner received the following:
• Certificate of Appreciation from the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine
• Certificate of Appreciation from UPASF

The evidence includes some information about the National Olympic Committee (was not all legible); however, the information that was legible appeared to be about the Committee and not the award. No information was submitted about the recognition from UPASF.

The evidence does not establish the Certificates of Appreciation are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

In response to the RFE, the petitioner submitted regulations, certificates, meeting minutes, letters, and other documents.

The evidence shows that the petitioner received a Certificate of Appreciation from the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine, issued in 2021. The accompanying nomination form states that petitioner was nominated for this award "for her professional, civic, and charitable merits that exemplify women's leadership and dedication to humanitarian service," through her work with families and children displaced due to the Russian invasion. The record does not establish that this award is related to the field of aerial and pole sports and that it was awarded to the petitioner for excellence as a coach or scout in the field aerial and pole sports.

The evidence shows that the petitioner received a Certificate of Appreciation from the All-Ukrainian NGO, Sports Committee of Ukraine, issued in 2024, for "facilitating the organization of tournaments in memory of the fallen defenders of Ukraine in non-Olympic sports." The record does not establish that this award is related to the field of aerial and pole sports and that it was awarded to the petitioner for excellence as a coach or scout in the field aerial and pole sports.

The petitioner also submitted a Certificate of Honor from the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine, issued on August 6, 2025. This certificate was issued after the receipt date of this petition, July 25, 2025, and thus cannot be entered into the record as evidence.

Although the petitioner submitted evidence of received awards, neither award appears to relate to the petitioner's field of aerial and pole sports. Neither award appears to be nationally or internationally recognized for excellence in the field of aerial and pole sports.

A prize or an award does not garner national or international recognition from a competition in which it is awarded, nor is it derived from the organization that issued it. Rather, national and international recognition results through the awareness of the accolade in the eyes of the field nationally or internationally.

The reputation of the event or organization conferring a prize or award does not necessarily establish that the prize or award is nationally or internationally recognized. Importantly, it is the recognition that the prize or award receives in the field on a broader level, beyond the event or organization which issued it, that determines whether it satisfies all elements of this criterion.

In order to fulfill this criterion, the petitioner must establish that he has been the recipient of awards or prizes that are nationally or internationally recognized for excellence in the field of endeavor. Relevant considerations regarding whether the basis for granting the prizes or awards was excellence in the field include, but are not limited to, the criteria used to grant the prizes or awards, the national or international significance of the prizes or awards in the field, and the number of awardees or prize recipients as well as any limitations on competitors.

Sufficiently probative evidence that an award is nationally or internationally recognized is generally material from sources besides the issuing entity. Krasniqi v. Dibbins, 558 F. Supp. 3d 168, 183 (D.N.J. 2021).

As such, the submitted evidence does not meet this criterion.

Documentation of the beneficiary's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

You have provided

a) Documentation about Medals
b) Documentation about an award
c) Information about grantee
d) Information about previous winners
e) Media publications

The petitioner has submitted prizes or awards received by the beneficiary that are not considered to be nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor. A prize or an award does not garner national or international recognition from the competition in which it is awarded, nor is it derived from the individual or group that issued the award. Rather, national and international recognition results through the awareness of the accolade in the eyes of the field nationally or internationally. This recognition should be evident through specific means, for example, through media coverage. Additionally, unsupported conclusory letters from those in the Petitioner's field are not sufficient evidence that a particular prize or award is nationally or internationally recognized. See 1756, Inc. v. The Attorney General of the United States, 745 F. Supp. 9, 15 (D.C. Dist. 1990).

The record contains evidence of the awards or prizes in the field. The evidence shows that the petitioner was given a Medal of Honor - Professional of the Year in 2023 and Medal of Excellence in 2022 by the National Business Ratings. The petitioner also received the People award for international Tax Expert of the Year from the Teens and People Magazine. The record also contains evidence about the awards, the issuing organizations, and letters of support as well as information about previous winners and award judges. However, the evidence is insufficient to ascertain that the awards or prizes are nationally recognized or internationally recognized. The petitioner is required to submit objective documentary evidence relating to the significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition that the prizes or awards share. The record contains insufficient evidence to satisfy each of the plain language elements of this criterion.

Documentation of the alien's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

The petitioner submitted the following evidence:

• Medal of Honor Professional of the Year award documentation;
• Medal of Excellence for Special Achievements award documentation;
• People Awards documentation;
• Titan Award documentation;
• Scholarship award documentation;
• Organizational awards; and
• Information about the awards and awarding organizations.

The plain language of this criterion requires evidence (1) of the beneficiary's receipt of a prize or award, (2) that the prize or award is in beneficiary's field, (3) that the prize or award is recognized nationally or internationally, and (4) that the award or prize is for excellence in the field of endeavor. The petitioner must satisfy all of these elements to meet the plain language requirements of this criterion.

The record establishes the beneficiary was awarded several awards and scholarships. However, there is no objective evidence to ascertain whether the awards or prizes are nationally recognized or internationally recognized, for excellence in the field of endeavor, and in the beneficiary's field. Additionally, the petitioner provided various articles about the awards. The articles discuss the award ceremonies and lists previous award winners. However, the articles does not demonstrate a level of media coverage associated with a nationally or internationally recognized award in the beneficiary's field. Without objective documentary evidence about the awards or prizes, the petitioner impedes USCIS in determining whether the awards or prizes satisfy all of the elements within this criterion.

Furthermore, the record establishes that the Globee Award and the National Business rating awards were awarded to the company Finexpertiza Kazakhstan LLP and Aaron Tax and Advisory LLC and not the beneficiary. The plain language of this criterion requires the petitioner's to document the beneficiary's receipt of the award. The award appears to have been conferred to an organization or a third party. Awards presented to a third party or organization are not sufficient to establish eligibility under this criterion because the beneficiary did not actually receive the award.

As such, the submitted evidence does not meet this criterion.

The record must contain sufficient evidence to satisfy each of the plain language elements of this criterion. Therefore, please submit evidence:

To show the beneficiary's receipt of an award, for any prize or award submitted, please provide:
• A copy of each prize or award certificate;
• A clear photograph of each prize or award; or
• Public announcement regarding the awarding of the prizes or awards issued by the granting organization.

To show that the prizes or awards are in the beneficiary's field, please submit:
• Documentary evidence of national or international prizes or awards received that were granted for excellence in the beneficiary's field;
• Documentary evidence establishing what the criteria was for winning the prizes or awards;
• Documentary evidence describing how the prizes or awards relate to the beneficiary's field;
• Documentary evidence of the following:
  - The significance of the prizes or awards;
  - Who is considered for the prizes or awards;
  - How many prizes or awards are given each year; and
  - Previous winners who are related to the beneficiary's field.

To show that they are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards, please submit:
• Objective documentary evidence demonstrating the following:
  - The criteria used to grant the prizes or awards;
  - The significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition that the prizes or awards share;
  - The reputation of the organization or panel granting the prizes or awards;
  - Who is considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope from which candidates may apply;
  - How many prizes or awards are awarded each year; and
  - Previous winners of the prizes or awards.

To demonstrate excellence in the field was the basis for the prizes or awards, the petitioner may submit:
• Objective, documentary evidence describing how the prizes or awards relate to excellence in the beneficiary's field; and

(i) Documentation of the self-petitioner's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor.

The criterion is not met.
The plain language of this criterion requires evidence (1) that you be the recipient of any prizes or awards; and (2) that the prize or award be nationally or internationally recognized for excellence in the field of endeavor.
USCIS Policy Manual: Volume 6, Part F, Chapter 2 expresses:

- First, USCIS determines if the person was the recipient of prizes or awards. Nothing precludes the person from relying on a team award, provided the person is one of the recipients of the award. The description of this type of evidence in the regulation indicates that the focus should be on the person's receipt of the awards or prizes, as opposed to the employer's receipt of the awards or prizes.
- Second, USCIS determines whether the award is a lesser nationally or internationally recognized prize or award which the person received for excellence in the field of endeavor.
Considerations: relevant considerations regarding whether the basis for granting the prizes or awards was excellence in the field include, but are not limited to: the criteria used to grant the awards or prizes; the national or international significance of the awards or prizes in the field; the number of awardees or prize recipients; and limitations on competitors.
Similarly, national or international recognition is most often associated with awards given to individuals at the highest level in a given field.
You provided evidence that you received first place in the Top 5 Best Reports delivered within the PHP Russia 2024 section. However, you did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the award was given in the highest level of the field and was nationally or internationally recognized for excellence in the field of endeavor. For example, you provided evidence from the awarding entity such as letters, general provisions, and printouts from its website. However, you did not provide sufficient independent and objective evidence to demonstrate that you received the award, that the award had garnered national or international media coverage that would verify the award, that the award was given at the highest level of the field, and was nationally or internationally recognized for excellence in the field of endeavor. In addition, while the supporting evidence may reflect institutional recognition, it does not reflect national or international recognition for excellence in the field. The evidence of record does not demonstrate that the awards were/are recognized beyond the institution on a national or international level.
Furthermore, you did not submit "ordinary legible photocopies of all original documentary evidence, reflecting their original size from the original source. For example, you provided evidence that includes digitized material, possibly scanned, and some altered. Digital, self-made copies of documentation that include altered material or information pasted (text, pictures, etc.) into your own self-created document will not be given probative value. Furthermore, with respect to documents from the Internet, you must submit webpage screen shots (including the URL address and page number on each page) as they would appear on the original source's website. You submitted webpage screen shots not as they appear (did not include the URL address and page number on each page) on the original source's website. Instead, you submitted self-made documentation either missing the URL address and/or the page number on each page, rather than providing the online webpages from the original source with the original URL address and page numbers on each page. Furthermore, it appears you submitted self-made documentation where you pasted specific portions of information (text, pictures, etc.) from the original webpage (articles or information). This undermines the credibility of this documentation because it did not originate from the original source. Moreover, documents from the Internet, screen shots of website publications should show the full URL address and include page numbers from the original source. This allows for source identification, verification of the information provided, and to determine whether the screen shot is complete and accurate. Internet webpage screen shots lacking an URL address and page numbers from the original source are of little probative value as the statements or assertions contained therein cannot be corroborated, nor can we verify the screen shot is complete. Therefore, webpage screen shots from the internet lacking the original URL addresses and page numbers from the original source are of little probative value and will not be considered. This material is not reliable documentation, nor does it comply with the regulatory requirements at 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b)(3). Eligibility is to be determined not by the quantity of the filings alone but by their quality.Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. at 376 (citing Matter of E-M-, 20 I&N Dec. 77, 80 (Comm'r 1989)). We "examine each piece of evidence for relevance, probative value, and credibility, both individually and within the context of the totality of the evidence." Id.

- Documentary evidence of national or international prizes or awards received that were granted for excellence in the beneficiary's field.
- Documentary evidence establishing what the criterion was for winning the prizes or awards.
- Documentary evidence describing how the prizes or awards relate to the beneficiary's field.
- Documentary evidence of the following:

- A copy of each prize or award certificate; or
- A clear photograph of each prize or award; or
- Public announcement regarding the awarding of the prizes or awards issued by the granting organization.
To show that they are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field, the petitioner may submit:
- Documentary evidence demonstrating the following:
o The criteria used to grant the prizes or awards;
o The significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition that the prizes or awards share;
o The reputation of the organization or panel granting the prizes or awards;
o Who is considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope for which candidates may apply;
o How many prizes or awards are awarded each year; and,
o Previous winners of the award.

Documentation of the beneficiary's receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes and awards for excellence in the field of endeavor

USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 6, Part F, Chapter 2 states:

First, USCIS determines if the person was the recipient of prizes or awards. The description of this type of evidence in the regulation indicates that the focus should be on the person's receipt of the awards or prizes, as opposed to the employer's receipt of the awards or prizes.
Second, USCIS determines whether the award is a lesser nationally or internationally recognized prize or award which the person received for excellence in the field of endeavor. As indicated by the plain language of the regulation, this criterion does not require an award or prize to have the same level of recognition and prestige associated with the Nobel Prize or another award that would qualify as a one-time achievement.

Examples of qualifying awards may include, but are not limited to:

Certain awards from well-known national institutions or well-known professional associations;

Certain doctoral dissertation awards; and

Certain awards recognizing presentations at nationally or internationally recognized conferences.

Considerations:

Relevant considerations regarding whether the basis for granting the prizes or awards was excellence in the field include, but are not limited to:

The criteria used to grant the awards or prizes;

The national or international significance of the awards or prizes in the field;

The number of awardees or prize recipients; and

Limitations on competitors.

Evidence submitted in support of this criterion includes:

Awards.

Title 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b)(3) holds:
Any document containing foreign language submitted to [USCIS] shall be accompanied by a full English language translation which the translator has certified as complete and accurate, and by the translator's certification that he or she is competent to translate from the foreign language into English.

The petitioner submitted foreign language documents with accompanying English language translations. However, the petitioner did not provide the translator's certification that he or she is competent to translate from the foreign language into English. Therefore, translations without proper translator's certification are unacceptable and do not comply with the terms of 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b)(3).

Even if we were to consider these documents, the evidence is insufficient to meet the plain language of this criterion. The petitioner submitted certificates and pictures of trophies, but did not provide documentary evidence conveying that the awards are nationally or internationally recognized for excellence in the field of endeavor nor evidence establishing that the HVAC System Design Tools field (as a whole) considers these events or organizations to be prestigious. As such, the plain language of this criterion has not been met.

If the petitioner believes that the prizes or awards are nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field, the petitioner may submit:

The criteria used to give the prizes or awards.

Information on the reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards.

Documentary evidence demonstrating:

The significance of the prizes or awards, to include the national or international recognition the prizes or awards share;

The reputation of the organization granting the prizes or awards;

Who is considered for the prizes or awards, including the geographic scope for which candidates may apply;

How many prizes or awards are awarded each year;

Previous winners who enjoy national or international acclaim; and,

Documentary evidence establishing how the award(s) was/were given for excellence in the beneficiary's field.

Please highlight any part of the documentation which relates to the criteria of excellence, the award's significance in the beneficiary's field, application process, number of prizes granted and how often, and national recognition of the award itself.

Note: For any prize or award submitted, please also provide:

A copy of each prize or award certificate; or

A clear photograph of each prize or award; or

Public announcement regarding the awarding of the prizes or awards issued by the granting organization.

The record shows that the petitioner was awarded the Independent National Competition Psychology Viktor Frankl Project of the Year in Psychology award.

The record did not include evidence establishing that the field as a whole considers the event or organization is prestigious. As such, the petitioner has not met the plain language of this criterion.
